## Release

- [June 1] 🔥 We released **LLaVA-Med: Large Language and Vision Assistant for Biomedicine**, a step towards building biomedical domain large language and vision models with GPT-4 level capabilities.  Checkout the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08485)

  *LLaVA-Med was initialized with the general-domain LLaVA and then continuously trained in a curriculum learning fashion (first biomedical concept alignment then full-blown instruction-tuning). We evaluated LLaVA-Med on standard visual conversation and question answering tasks.*

## LLaVA-Med Dataset

  *The data statistics of biomedical multimodal instruction-following data: (a,b) The root verb-noun pairs of instruction and responses, where the inner circle of the plot represents the root verb of the output response, and the outer circle represents the direct nouns. (c) The distribution of images and QA pairs on the five domains, one image is shown per domain.*

## LLaVA-Med Performance

  *Performance comparison of mulitmodal chat instruction-following abilities, measured by the relative score via language GPT-4 evaluation.*

  *Example 1: comparison of medical visual chat. The language-only GPT-4 is considered as the performance upper bound, as the golden captions and inline mentions are fed into GPT-4 as the context, without requiring the model to understand the raw image.*

  *Example 2: comparison of medical visual chat. LLaVA tends to halluciate or refuse to provide domain-specific knowledgable response.*
